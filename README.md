# TodoList-DummyProject
This project is made with the help of in28minutes. This is basically a follow up project in one of the courses of in28minutes. The project helps one to keep track of his/her goals by providing basic RestFunctionalities in springBoot. This project gives a beautiful glimpse of making a simple but interactive Login/Logout applicaiton. The project is still incomplete in aspect of security and needs to be integrated with springBoot security. Moreover, the authentication of login is hardCoded which need to be moved to a dataBase based authentication. However, the application is powerful in functionality and consumes the concept of REST Api, SpringBoot, Angular, SessionCokieStorage, Login/Logout Responsive Functionality.
